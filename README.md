My research interests are low dimensional topology. In particular, my works find new differences between the smooth world and the continuous world in dimension 4. My advisor is Danny Ruberman.

## Math Project

#### Surgery formulas for Seiberg-Witten invariants and family Seiberg-Witten invariants ([Draft](./surgery.pdf))
- We prove a surgery formula for the ordinary Seiberg-Witten invariants, and a surgery formula for the families Seiberg-Witten invariants of families of 4-manifolds obtained through fibrewise surgery. Our formula expresses the Seiberg-Witten invariants of the manifold after the surgery, in terms of the original Seiberg-Witten moduli space cut down by a cohomology class in the configuration space. We use these surgery formulas to study how a surgery can preserve or produce exotic phenomena.

#### Exotic diffeomorphism on $4$-manifolds with $b_2^+ = 2$ ([Draft](./critical.pdf))
- While the exotic diffeomorphisms turned out to be very rich, we know much less about the $b^+_2 =2$ case, because parameterized gauge-theoretic invariants are not well defined. In this paper we present a method to find exotic diffeomorphisms on simply-connected smooth closed $4$-manifolds with $b^+_2 =2$, and as a result we obtain that $2\CP^2 \# 10 \overline{\CP^2}$ admits exotic diffeomorphisms.

#### Dehn twist on a sum of two homology $4$-tori
- In this project we construct an exotic diffeomorphism on a nonsimply connected manifold without the need for an exotic smooth structure. The main theorem of this project is: If $X1,X_2$ are two homology tori such that the determinants $r_1,r_2$ of them are odd. Then the Dehn twist along a $3$-sphere in the neck of $X_1\# X_2$ is not smoothly isotopic to the identity.

## Engineering Project

[cube-solver](https://github.com/hcqiu/cube-solver)

An Embedded project to solve Rubik's cube, built by Java and implemented by a robot constructed from LEGO bricks. I use maching learning to recognize colors on the cube.
